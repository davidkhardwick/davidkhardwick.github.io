Researched Stanford Grad vs Certificate yesterday
* Found the videos for the CSS 221 class online [here](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2024/modules/)

* Since I plan on doing my own thing, I don’t need a cert or grad creds from Stanford, just need to learn it. Won’t have network and support with problems, but if I can’t do them then I’ll go else where to get similar problems that show the solutions.
* Linear algebra first
    * Why?
