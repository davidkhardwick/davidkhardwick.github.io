# Day 4 - Uncertain of current path

Found myself doubting if I'm on the right path with just this Standford course, so I did some more searching on Roadmaps for AI/ML

* Found more ‘AI Engineer Roadmap’ resources
https://course.fast.ai/
* Also hands on…**I think I’m going to start here. Because it is more hands-on.**

## Big Insight
* **Actually, I'm going to do both the Stanford (theoretical) and Fast.ai (hands-on) courses to see if they complement each other, or if one is more helpful than the other, and just stop doing the less helpful one.**

* [Perfect Roadmap To Become AI Engineers In 2024 With Free Videos And Materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkhUjwJbP1k)
    * Pretty good, all free stuff (truly free)
    * Good set of ‘playlists’ for other topics
* [AI Engineer Roadmap | How I'd Learn AI in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhCHrvfAXlc)
*  Code basics provides training, which they recommend as alternatives in a few places in the PDF

* [GitHub Page listing out an AI roadmap, seeing a lot of overlap from other such roadmaps (graduated 2024)](

* [Benedict Neo (graduated 2024)](https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/a-roadmap-to-learn-ai-in-2024-cc30c6aa6e16)

    * This curriculum follows a top-down approach — code first, theory later.
