* [Game Playing 1 - Minimax, Alpha-beta Pruning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pU-Hrz_xy4&list=PLoROMvodv4rOca_Ovz1DvdtWuz8BfSWL2&index=21)
    * Talking about Two-player, Zero-Sum games (Turn-taking games - Chess, Checkers, different players in control, one at a time)
        * Players = {agent, opp}   (chess example: white, black)
        * S<sub>start</sub>        (chess example: board setup)
        * Actions(s) : possible actions from state s (chess example: <haven’t discussed yet>)
        * Suc(s,a): resulting state if choose action a in state s 
        * IsEnd(s): whether is an end state (game over)
        * Utility(s): agents’ utility for end state S<sub>end</sub> (utility needs to add up to zero)
            * You only get the utility at the end of the game
    * Policies
    *   Deterministic policies or Stochastic Policies (random)
    * Expectiminimax recurrence (we add a player => Players = {agent, opp, coin}
    * Primitives: max notes, chance nodes, min nodes
    * Composition: alternate notes according to model of game
    * Value function V…(s): recurrence for expected utility
    * Scenarios to think about
        * What if you are playing against multiple opponents?
        * What if you and your partner have to take turns (table tennis)?
        * Some actions allow you to take an extra turn?
    * Computation complexity 
        * Approach: Tree Search
        * Complexity: branching factor b, dept d (2d – agent plays, then opponent plays)
            * O(d) space (memory), and O(b<sup>2d</sup>)
            * For Chess, b ~= 35, d~=50 which is close to the number of atoms in the universe
            * VERY BAD, SO….HOW DO WE SPEED IT UP?? Minimax
    * Speeding up Minimax
        * Evaluation Functions - use domain-specific knowledge, compute approximate answer
            * What if we limit the depth? And lean on domain specific knowledge
            * Chess ex:  material worth, mobility, king-safety, center-control
        * Alpha-beta pruning - general-purpose, compute exact answer
         * Drop sub-tree nodes when you can see that the nodes at the current level don’t overlap
        
    * Alpha-beta Pruning
