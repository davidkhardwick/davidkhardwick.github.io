# Day 1 - Planning to take the Stanford AI course
* Former business school classmate, but also developer, took this class and recommended it
* He sent along some primers on Linear Algebra and Probability
* I wrongly read the Probability one first, and then after reading the Linear Algebra primer it was obvious after page 2 that I read them out of order
* Linear Algebra - I’ve been helping my high school son with his math for years (I’ve had a lot of math as an engineer at Lehigh) but I had this thread going in the back of my head saying, “Do I need to learn this, and if so, then how deeply?” 
* I needed a break and was looking at some other resources for learning AI/ML, that led me to this set of YouTube videos, the first one here: [Linear Algebra - Math for Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/uZeDTwWcnuY?si=i-r1lj3N8esOE-C1)
  * Wow, this video really started to connect the dots on what I was reading in these primers and helped me as a developer to understand the analogous meanings of models, inputs/outputs, etc.
    * Many objects are represented by arrays in machine learning:
        * Almost always: data (inputs and outputs)
        * Very often: models (equivalent to programs)
        * Often: internal computations of models (local variables)
* “Do I need to learn this?” → yes
    * I’m more motivated now to ready this primer
* “If so, then how deeply?” → TBD…I am pretty sure this is going to be a circuitous journey on math depth, not a linear one.
