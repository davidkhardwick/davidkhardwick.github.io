* [Knowledge Graphs for RAG](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/knowledge-graphs-rag/lesson/1/introduction)
    * Helped me understand creating embeddings on your data, where the vector embeddings are stored. How to expand the context on the matches you get before feeding it to the LLM prompt.
    * Knowledge graphs make it easier to provide relationship information to the corpus of data that gets embedded for searching, or allows you to pull additional data after results are pulled from the LLM based on relationships.
    * Few shot learning to teach LLM how to make queries from the Graph DB --> Examples of Tools/Extensions
