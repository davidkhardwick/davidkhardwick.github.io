# Day 11 - NLP intro, Python Data Processing Resources

# Nov 12, 2024

* Python
    * Two Python Data Processing resources to consider [these books](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1gcsxj2/choose_only_one_book_machine_learning_with/)


* (Fast.ai)

    * Completed the recommended intro lesson on NLP for [lesson 4](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson4.html)
https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/getting-started-with-nlp-for-absolute-beginners	 
    * [How (and why) to create a good validation set](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2017-11-13-validation-sets.html)
    * [Iterate like a grand champion](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/iterate-like-a-grandmaster/)
    * Completed [Lesson 4 - video](https://youtu.be/toUgBQv1BT8)

* Google Colab
    *   Learned that all Google Colab notebooks for this course are linked [here!](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/README.md) but after using Colab, I found their 'free' tier to be quite limiting compared to what Kaggle provides. I'm sticking with Kaggle for now.

* (Standford)
    * [Non-linear Features](https://youtu.be/eIxbNkB4byY?si=OYZNDAUjS17QE9Np)
        * Linear in what? Shows how the w*phi(x) is still linear, even when x is non-linear. This worked for both regression and classification.
    *[Feature Templates](https://youtu.be/2QfSBLtvioE?si=bAtLQ75_P2WYIWe_)
        * Example with an email address, and how you can define features with templates using either dense pre-defined arrays, or feature dictionaries that get defined dynamically (e.g., only non-zero features…which is ‘endsWith_com’ for one email but would be ‘endsWith_org’ for another)


* Post two more blog articles.
