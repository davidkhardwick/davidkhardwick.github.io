* (Fast.ai) - Finished [Lesson 2 video](https://youtu.be/F4tvM4Vb3A0?si=PkG7cRwHaiYRN6tA) and [reading](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb) (...but I could do more by setting up my environment to run Jupyter Notebooks locally on my machine, which would allow me to use the ‘widgets’ in the examples shown for cleaning data.)

* Ask Stanford bot if I could get access to Canvas materials if I purchased any of the courses. Finally got a person. Answer is 'not unless I enroll as a graduate student.'
